# Basic structure of a for loop is of the kind:

for (item in list_of_items){
  do_something(item)
  print()
}

# Like for every student in a class, vaccinate. So every student must get the 
# vaccine. 

# For better appreciation, let me create a vector called volumes of three numbers.

volumes <- c(1.6, 3, 8)
